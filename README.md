# Personal-Website

Personal website developed in 2020 as an introduction to web development.

After taking a drastic U-turn in my career from business to computer science, I attempted to produce a self-absorbed personal website. This website conveyed what is essentially my CV, albeit in a more colourful format. Though basic and raw, it allowed me to apply my understanding of HTML (lists, tables, forms, divs) and CSS (classes, ids, box model styling, positioning), as well as introducing me to the vast world of web development.
